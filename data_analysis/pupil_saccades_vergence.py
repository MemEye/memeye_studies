#TODO: higher level feature processing (vergence, saccade duration, etc)

# take in the processed eye_0 and eye_1 files for each user, 
# and calculate the saccades and vergence for each eye
# saccades code similar to sams, vergence will need to be calculated
# output is the same files as before, with saccades and vergence added in
